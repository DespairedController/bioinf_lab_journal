## Project description
### ANTIBIOTIC_RESISTANCE
#### “What causes antibiotic resistance?” Alignment to reference, variant calling
The goals are to analyze that sequencing data from a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin to locate the mutations responsible for giving E. coli its antibiotic resistance property, to research the genes that are mutated to identify the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in each case, and to make recommendations for alternative antibiotics a doctor could use to treat each strain.

#### Plan
1. Get data
2. Inspect raw sequencing data manually
3. Inspect raw sequencing data with fastqc.
4. Filtering the reads.
5. Aligning sequences to reference
6. Variant calling
7. Variant effect prediction
8. Writing lab report
