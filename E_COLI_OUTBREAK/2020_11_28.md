## Project description
E COLI OUTBREAK 28.11.2020

The goal is to reproduce part of [E. coli O104:H4 Genome Analysis](https://github.com/ehec-outbreak-crowdsourced/BGI-data-analysis/wiki) on TY2482 sequencing data and answer following questions:
1. What is genomic sequence of E.Coli X?
2. What strain of E. coli is E. coli X most similar to? (Where did it come from?)
3. What are the genes that E. coli X contains?
4. Which of these genes make E. coli X distinct?
5. How did E. coli X evolve to obtain these genes?
6. How did E. coli X become pathogenic?

## Impact of reads with large insert size
 Runned spades on all three libraries.

 | stat    | 1l assembly | 3l assembly |
 | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
 | contigs |     205     |     105     |
 |   N50   |   105346    |    335515   |

## Genome annotation
Runned Procca:
```
prokka --compliant scaffolds3l.fasta

```
Runned barcamp to find 16S:
```
	barrnap --threads 8 scaffolds3l.fasta > out.gff
```
Extracted 16S sequence:
```
grep '16S' out.gff > 16S.gff;
bedtools getfasta -fi scaffolds3l.fasta -bed 16S.gff -fo 16S.fna
```
Runned blastn on `16S.fna`, found `NC_011748.1` --- Escherichia coli 55989, complete genome.
