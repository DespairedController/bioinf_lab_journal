## Project description
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE 4.11.2020

The goals are to analyze that sequencing data from a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin to locate the mutations responsible for giving E. coli its antibiotic resistance property, to research the genes that are mutated to identify the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in each case, and to make recommendations for alternative antibiotics a doctor could use to treat each strain.

## Variant calling
Creating `.mpileup` file:
```
samtools mpileup -f reference_seq/GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.fna alignment_sorted.bam > my.mpileup
```
Calling variants with VarScan:
```
java -jar VarScan.v2.4.2.jar mpileup2snp my.mpileup  --min-var-freq 0.85 --variants --output-vcf 1 > VarScan_results.vcf
```
Results:
```
4641476 bases in pileup file
9 variant positions (6 SNP, 3 indel)
1 were failed by the strand-filter
5 variant positions reported (5 SNP, 0 indel)
```

## Variant effect prediction
Using IGV found five mutations: 
1. in position `93043` (`C -> G`, `Ala -> Gly`, mutation in `b0084` gene) -- missense mutation
2. in position `482698` (`T -> G`, `Gln -> Arg`, mutation in `b0462` gene) -- missense mutation
3. in position `852768` (`A -> G`, , `? -> ?`) -- synonimous mutation
4. in position `3535147` (`T -> G`, , `Val -> Gly` mutation in `b3404` gene) -- missense mutation
5. in position `3535147` (`C -> A`, , `Ala -> Ala`) -- synonymous mutation

## Writing lab report
Well, ampcillin is beta-lactam antibiotic, product of `b0084` is penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3), and, what a coincidence, beta-lactam antibiotics interacts with penicillin binding proteins.

Also, product of `b0462`is AcrB RND-type permease, which is part of AcrAB-TolC Multidrug Efflux System, which takes part in kicking drug out of cell.
